- stream splitting

Disadvantage (in general)
- async (not always idead)

MB providers
- RabbitMQ, Mosquitto, Apache Kafka, ZeroMQ, Apache ActiveMQ, Google Cloud PubSub, Azure Scheduler, KubeMQ (k8s native)

- priority queues
- level of service - delivery guarantees
- dead letter queues (SQS)
- telemetry - statistics on the queues

RabbitMQ specific - topic vs channel
